## I'll pack my bags and go

You've got your dependencies handled and all is good. Or sort of good.

It is tedious to set up dependencies on each system that you want to run on.

Luckily you know how to use Docker.

### Task

- Create a `Dockerfile` containing your application code and requirements
- Build the Docker image
- Run the application in Docker with a docker-compose file
- Check Dockerfile and compose file into your repository.
