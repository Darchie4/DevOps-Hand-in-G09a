## Cut out the boring stuff

> FIXME: TASK

Every time that release time comes around, you get uncomfortable.
You do not feel safe about deploying to production.
Deploying by hand always feels like that nothing is entirely the same each time.

Guess it's time to script continuous delivery?

### Task

- Create a script that runs the application on your server.
    (tip, you can use the ssh key you were given to the cloud instance.
    Look here fore more guidance:
    https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2019/02/06/ssh-steps-for-jenkins-pipeline/)
- Augment your script such that you can deploy to multiple targets
    ( eg. local, staging, production ).
- If you are more people in the team,
    try to push your code to one of the other servers,
    using its private IP (You can get that by issuing the command `ifconfig`).
